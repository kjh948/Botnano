# Kaia.ai platform robot firmware

Use this open-source firmware to easily make (relatively advanced) self-driving Arduino/ROS2 robots equipped with a spinning Lidar distance sensor. Currently, I support out-of-the-box the differential (2-wheel) round base with a rear caster.

## Compatible Lidars

List of [supported Lidar models here](https://github.com/kaiaai/LDS). I wrote this Arduino Lidar library.

## Compatible Motors

### Steering
- supports differential steering (2 motors with a coaster wheel)
- 4WD skid steering, mechanum, 3WD omniwheels on the TODO list

### Brushed Motors
- supports motor drivers with two inputs (IN1/IN2)
  - including L298N, TB6612FNG, DRV8871, DRV8833, DRV8835, etc.
- supports motors with two (quadrature) encoder outputs
  - including N20, GA25-370, etc.

### Brushless (BLDC) Motors
- supports ESC controller (PWM, CW and FG pins)
- BLDC motors with these specifications are recommended
  - 9..24V voltage (higher voltage increases efficiency)
  - models JGA25-2418, JGA25-2430; 24.4mm outer diameter
  - ~190..450 no-load (max) RPM, ~140..350 rated RPM
  - JST SH 1.0mm 5-pin connector on the back (PWM, CW/CCW, VMOT, GND, FG)
  - built-in BLDC driver and encoder
  - ~0.5..1.5 Kg*cm rated torque 
- Examples
  - CHR-GM25-BL2418 24V 200RPM 270PPR
  - JGA25-BL2418 24V 245RPM 630PPR
  - CHR-GM25-BL2418 24V 260RPM 204PPR
  - JGA25-BL2418 24V 408RPM 127.8PPR
  - CHR-GM25-BL2418 24V 450RPM 120PPR

### Where to Purchase Motors/Components
- [Maker's Pet online store](https://makerspet.com/store)
- AliExpress
- Ebay
- Amazon
- online robotics specialty stores
  - robotshop.com
- in India
  - robu.in, zbotic.in, robokits.co.in, robocraze.com, roboticsdna.in, probots.co.in, roboindia.com, flipkart.com, digikey.in, mouser.in, in.element14.com

### Choosing a Motor
- choose a motor with a minimum rated torque of ~0.5Kg*cm (a guess). Your motor must have enough torque
  - to accelerate the weight of your robot reasonably quickly, let's say 2lbs or so
  - to drive over thick carpet, floor mats, etc.
- for the given rated torque, choose a motor with the highest RPM
  - the higher the motor RPM, the faster your robot can drive
- we recommend 24V BLDC ~400 RPM motors, e.g. JGA25-BL2418 24V 408RPM 127.8PPR
  - these motors are fast, powerful and (generally) long-lasting
- 12V BLDC ~300 RPM is the second choice
  - often 12V BLDC offer less torque at the same RPM compared to 24V BLDC motors
- if you cannot get a BLDC motor, get yourself a brushed GA25-370 motor with encoder
  - this motor is (generally) less powerful compared to the recommended BLDC motors
  - brushed motors (generally) do not last as long as BLDC motors
- if you cannot get a GA25-370 motor, you can use N20 motors as the last resort
  - N20 motors have considerably less torque compared to the recommended motors
  - However, some N20 motors with low RPM (e.g. <=100RPM) do offer sufficient torque
